We cherish the &ldquo;ahh moments&rdquo; &mdash; those little instances where the distractions of the rest of the world are drowned out and you can finally relax &mdash; like that moment when you first hear the waves of the Pacific, or the moment you first feel the sand in your toes, or the moment you pull up to Beach Terrace Inn. <br />Let us show you how to get slow.</p>"
